     * task that it does not intend to run. By making producers run the task that they
     * have just produced avoids execution delays and avoids parallel slow down by running
     * the task in the same core, with good chances of having a hot CPU cache. It also
     * avoids the creation of a queue of produced tasks that the system does not yet have
     * capacity to consume, which can save memory and exert back pressure on producers.
